### kotlin multiplatform project with flutter.

Following "Add Flutter to an existing app" part "Option B - Depend on the moduleâ€™s source code" in the docs did not work for me without some additional changes in the build scripts.

Changes made to the original project file, which was created with Android studio "new kotlin multiplatform project" are marked with `NOTE` in the build scriprs.
